## 🐛 Recent Issues Fixed

### Route Naming Mismatch (December 2024)

-   **Issue**: Error 500 on production - "Route [contact] not defined"
-   **Cause**: Route was named `contact.show` but view used `route('contact')`
-   **Fix**: Updated `welcome.blade.php` to use correct route name
-   **Prevention**: Added route verification to deployment checklist

### Lessons Learned

1. Always verify route names match between routes and views
2. Clear route cache after any route changes
3. VSCode Laravel extension may show false positives
4. Use `php artisan route:list` to verify routes
```
