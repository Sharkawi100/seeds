# Current Task: Quiz Attempt Tracking System âœ… COMPLETED

Last Updated: June 17, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Major Achievement: Complete Attempt Tracking Implementation

### âœ… Quiz Attempt Management System (June 17, 2025)

**Database Schema Enhancements:**

-   **Added `attempt_number`** column to `results` table with proper indexing
-   **Added `is_latest_attempt`** boolean flag for efficient querying
-   **Added `max_attempts`** column to `quizzes` table (nullable, 1-10 attempts)
-   **Added `scoring_method`** ENUM column: 'latest', 'average', 'highest', 'first_only'
-   **Implemented attempt tracking** for both registered users and guests

**Smart Attempt Tracking Logic:**

-   **Registered Users**: Tracked by `quiz_id + user_id` combination
-   **Guest Users**: Tracked by `quiz_id + guest_name` combination
-   **Automatic numbering**: Sequential attempt numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)
-   **Latest attempt flagging**: Only most recent attempt marked as latest
-   **Historical data migration**: All existing results properly numbered

### âœ… Enhanced Quiz Creation & Management

**Quiz Configuration Options:**

-   **Attempt Limits**: Teachers can set 1-10 attempts or unlimited
-   **Scoring Methods**:
    -   Latest score (default)
    -   Average of all attempts

## ðŸ“Š Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes Applied

```sql
-- Results table enhancements
ALTER TABLE `results`
ADD COLUMN `attempt_number` TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
ADD COLUMN `is_latest_attempt` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1,
ADD INDEX `idx_student_attempts` (`quiz_id`, `user_id`, `guest_name`, `attempt_number`);

-- Quiz configuration options
ALTER TABLE `quizzes`
ADD COLUMN `max_attempts` TINYINT UNSIGNED NULL DEFAULT 1,
ADD COLUMN `scoring_method` ENUM('latest','average','highest','first_only') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'average';

-- Data migration for existing records
UPDATE results r1
JOIN (
    SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY quiz_id, user_id ORDER BY created_at) as new_attempt_number
    FROM results WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL
) r2 ON r1.id = r2.id
SET r1.attempt_number = r2.new_attempt_number;

-- Guest attempt numbering
UPDATE results r1
JOIN (
    SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY quiz_id, guest_name ORDER BY created_at) as new_attempt_number
    FROM results WHERE user_id IS NULL AND guest_name IS NOT NULL
) r2 ON r1.id = r2.id
SET r1.attempt_number = r2.new_attempt_number;
```

### Backend Enhancements
