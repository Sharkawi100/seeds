-   Interactive charts with Arabic labels and RTL support
-   Real-time data visualization from database

**Database Integration Fixes:**

### ✅ Technical Fixes Applied

**Data Structure Issues:**

-   Subject relationship: `$quiz->subject->name` instead of direct property
-   Guest handling: Proper null checks for user relationships
-   Scores format: Dynamic parsing for array vs JSON string
-   Chart data: Proper Laravel collection conversion

**JavaScript Integration:**

-   Chart.js library integration with Arabic support
-   Responsive canvas elements with safety checks
-   Data type validation before JSON parsing

## 📊 Implementation Details

### Quiz Management Routes Added

```php
Route::patch('/{quiz}/toggle-status', [QuizController::class, 'toggleStatus'])->name('toggle-status');
Route::get('/{quiz}/results', [QuizController::class, 'results'])->name('results');
```

### Database Schema Used

-   `quizzes.subject_id` (foreign key) → `subjects.name`
-   `results.guest_name` (direct field for guest users)
-   `results.scores` (JSON field with root scores)
-   No time tracking fields (removed from display)

### Chart Implementation

-   **Radar Chart**: 4-roots performance averages
-   **Doughnut Chart**: Score distribution by grade ranges
-   **Data Source**: Real-time calculation from results table
-   **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly canvas sizing

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Results Data Flow

1. Controller fetches quiz with results relationship
2. Frontend calculates root averages from scores JSON
3. Charts render with processed data
4. Table displays individual student breakdowns

### Quiz Management Flow
