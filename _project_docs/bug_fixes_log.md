## Fix #001: Guest Quiz Results Redirect (June 15, 2025)

### Problem

-   Guests completing quizzes were redirected to `/login` instead of results page
-   Error: "Route [guest-result] not defined"
-   Database error: "Unknown column 'token' in 'WHERE'"

### Root Causes

1. **Missing Controller Method**: `ResultController@guestShow()` didn't exist
2. **Wrong Route Name**: Code used `guest-result` instead of `quiz.guest-result`
3. **Incorrect Route Binding**: Route used `{result:token}` but database column is `guest_token`

### Solution Applied

1. **Added guestShow() method** in `app/Http/Controllers/ResultController.php`:

    - Validates guest token and expiration
    - Loads necessary relationships
    - Returns results view

2. **Fixed redirect logic** in `app/Http/Controllers/QuizController.php`:

    - Changed from single redirect to conditional logic
    - Authenticated users → `results.show`
    - Guests → `quiz.guest-result`

3. **Corrected route binding** in `routes/web.php`:
    - Changed from `{result:token}` to `{result:guest_token}`

### Files Modified

-   `app/Http/Controllers/ResultController.php` - Added guestShow method
-   `app/Http/Controllers/QuizController.php` - Fixed submit method redirect
-   `routes/web.php` - Fixed route parameter binding
-   `_project_docs/routes_summary.md` - Updated documentation
-   `_project_docs/features_and_logic.md` - Updated guest journey
-   `_project_docs/project_structure.md` - Added fix notes

### Testing

✅ **Verified**: Guest can complete quiz and view results via token URL
✅ **Verified**: Session data properly maintained and cleared
✅ **Verified**: 7-day expiration works correctly

### Technical Notes

-   Guest session data stored as: `guest_name`, `school_class`
-   Results accessible via: `/quiz/result/{32-character-token}`
-   Token expires after 7 days for security
-   Route uses Laravel's route model binding for security

## Future Maintenance Notes

-   Always test guest flow when modifying quiz submission logic
-   Ensure route parameter names match database columns
-   Verify session management in guest workflows
